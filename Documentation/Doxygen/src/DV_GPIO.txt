\section gpio_config_detail Configuration settings

<b>Driver_GPIO#</b> selects the driver instance that will be tested.<br>
For example if we want to test <c>Driver_GPIO0</c> then this setting would be set to <c>0</c>.

<b>Configuration</b> section contains configuration of two pins:
- <b>Pin Under Test</b> specifying the pin that will be tested.<br>
- <b>Auxiliary Pin</b> specifies the auxiliary pin with serial low resistance resistor connected to Pin Under Test.
  Suggested resistance of this serial resistor is around 1 kOhm.<br>

<b>Pins</b> should not have any external resistors or any external devices connected to it except the low resistance resistor used for testing.<br>

<b>Tests</b> section contains selections of tests to be executed.
For details on tests performed by each test function please refer to \ref gpio_tests "GPIO Tests".
