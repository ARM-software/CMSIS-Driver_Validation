# CMSIS-Driver Validation

Test suite for verifying that a peripheral driver implementation is compliant with the corresponding [CMSIS-Driver Specification](https://arm-software.github.io/CMSIS_5/Driver/html/index.html).

## Overview
The branch **main** of this repository contains the code of CMSIS-Driver Validation Suite. [User documentation](http://arm-software.github.io/CMSIS-Driver_Validation/main/index.html) explains the scope and the usage of the framework.

[See verified releases](https://github.com/ARM-software/CMSIS-Driver_Validation/releases) of CMSIS-Driver Validation suite in source code archives and in [CMSIS-Pack (.pack)](https://open-cmsis-pack.github.io/Open-CMSIS-Pack-Spec/main/html/index.html) format as download assets.

Feel free to raise an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/ARM-software/CMSIS-Driver_Validation/issues) to report a misbehavior (i.e. bugs), start discussions about enhancements or create a pull request with suggested modifications.

### Supported Driver Interfaces

The CMSIS-Driver Validation provides tests for the following CMSIS-Driver interfaces:

Extensive tests with available test servers:
  - **SPI** - Serial Peripheral Interface driver.
  - **USART** - Universal Synchronous and Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter interface driver.
  - **WiFi** - Wireless Fidelity Interface module/shield driver.

Basic tests:
  - **CAN** - Controller Area Network interface driver.
  - **Ethernet** - Ethernet MAC and PHY peripheral interface driver.
  - **I2C** - Inter-Integrated Circuit multi-master serial single-ended bus interface - driver.
  - **MCI** - Memory Card Interface driver for SD/MMC memory.
  - **USB Device** - Universal Serial Bus Device interface driver.
  - **USB Host** - Universal Serial Bus Host interface driver.

## Examples

Folder [`Examples`](./Examples/) contains example projects that show how to use the CMSIS-Driver Validation on a real hardware with available CMSIS-Driver implementations. The examples are also included in CMSIS-Driver Validation Software Pack. Details are explained in [Examples documentation](https://arm-software.github.io/CMSIS-Driver_Validation/main/examples.html).

## Build CMSIS-Driver Validation as Open-CMSIS-Pack

 A generator script [`gen_pack.sh`](./gen_pack.sh) is provided for building the CMSIS-Driver Validation as [Open-CMSIS-Pack](https://open-cmsis-pack.github.io/Open-CMSIS-Pack-Spec/main/html/index.html) using the [gen-pack library](https://github.com/Open-CMSIS-Pack/gen-pack). Simply follow the steps below:
  
 - Verify that following tools are installed on the PC:
   - git bash (e.g. for Windows: https://gitforwindows.org/)
   - ZIP archive creation utility (e.g. [7-Zip](http://www.7-zip.org/download.html))
   - Doxygen version 1.13.2 (https://sourceforge.net/projects/doxygen/files/rel-1.13.2/)
 - Checkout this repository. For example in git bash with:
    ```git clone https://github.com/ARM-Software/CMSIS-Driver_Validation```
 - In the local repository folder execute `./gen_pack.sh` in the bash shell.
   - this creates a pack file in the local `output` folder. For example `./output/ARM.CMSIS-Driver_Validation.3.0.1-dev12+g3725082.pack`.
