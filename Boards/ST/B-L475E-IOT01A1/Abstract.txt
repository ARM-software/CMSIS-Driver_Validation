CMSIS-Driver Validation Example Project for STMicroelectronics 'STM32L475' 
microcontroller using STMicroelectronics 'B-L475E-IOT01A1' Evaluation Board 
with Wi-Fi module Inventek ISM43362-M3G-L44 (802.11 b/g/n compliant).

Features:
This uVision project can be used to test the CMSIS-Drivers for the STM32L475 
against the driver specification. Configure the tests as follows:

  - Main function cmsis_dv() can be found in DV_Framework.c, where test cases
    are executed
  - Test configuration options can be set with the Configuration Wizard in
    DV_Config.h:
    - Test result output format (plain text/XML)
    - Buffer sizes and patterns
    - Driver numbers
    - Specific peripheral parameters
    - Enable/disable test cases
  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The following targets are available:

  - Create Report:
    Results and statistics are printed to the file TestReport\TestReport.xml
    through the ITM output (to examine the results, open the XML document with
    the browser of your choice).
 
  - Debug:
    Results and statistics are printed to the Debug (printf) Viewer window
    through the ITM output.

Debugger : STLink

IMORTANT NOTE:
  - Configure parameters in DV_Config.h under WiFi - Configuration to suit
    your testing environment
