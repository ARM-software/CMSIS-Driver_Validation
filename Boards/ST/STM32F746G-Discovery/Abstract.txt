CMSIS-Driver Validation Example Project for ST 'STM32F746' microcontroller
using ST 'STM32F746G-Discovery' Evaluation Board.

Features:
This uVision project can be used to test the CMSIS-Drivers for the STM32F746
against the driver specification. Configure the tests as follows:

  - Main function cmsis_dv() can be found in DV_Framework.c, where test cases
    are executed
  - Test configuration options can be set with the Configuration Wizard in:
    DV_Config.h:
    - Test result output format (plain text/XML)
    DV_ETH_Config.h, DV_SPI_Config.h, DV_USART_Config.h, DV_I2C_Config.h,
    DV_MCI_Config.h and DV_USBD_Config.h:
    - Driver numbers
    - Specific peripheral parameters
    - Enable/disable test cases

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The following targets are available:

  - Create Report:
    Results and statistics are printed to the file TestReport\TestReport.xml
    through the ITM output (to examine the results, open the XML document with
    the browser of your choice).

    Note: Due to high CPU clock usually XML file will miss some content thus
          will be malformed.
          To get the proper XML try reducing the CPU clock and update all
          peripheral clocks accordingly.
 
  - Debug:
    Results and statistics are printed to the Debug (printf) Viewer window
    through the ITM output.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For driver loopback testing, please ensure that the following hardware
connections are made:

  - SPI:      PB14 (SPI2_MISO) and PB15 (SPI2_MOSI)
  - USART:    PC6  (USART6_TX) and PC7  (USART6_RX)
  - Ethernet: Pin 1 (TX+) and Pin 3 (RX+), Pin 2 (TX-) and Pin 6 (RX-).
              Prepare an Ethernet cable accordingly or use an 
              "Ethernet Loopback Plug".
