CMSIS-Driver Validation Example Project for ST 'STM32F207' microcontroller
using Keil 'MCBSTM32F200' Evaluation Board.

Features:
This uVision project can be used to test the CMSIS-Drivers for the STM32F207
against the driver specification. Configure the tests as follows:

  - Main function cmsis_dv() can be found in DV_Framework.c, where test cases
    are executed
  - Test configuration options can be set with the Configuration Wizard in:
    DV_Config.h:
    - Test result output format (plain text/XML)
    DV_ETH_Config.h, DV_I2C_Config.h, DV_MCI_Config.h, DV_SPI_Config.h, 
    DV_USART_Config.h and DV_USBD_Config.h:
    - Driver numbers
    - Specific peripheral parameters
    - Enable/disable test cases

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The following targets are available:

  - Create Report:
    Results and statistics are printed to the file TestReport\TestReport.xml
    through the ITM output (to examine the results, open the XML document with
    the browser of your choice).
 
  - Debug:
    Results and statistics are printed to the Debug (printf) Viewer window
    through the ITM output.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For driver loopback testing, please ensure that the following hardware
connections are made:

  - USART:    PB6  (USART1_TX) and PB7  (USART1_RX)
  - SPI:      PB14 (SPI2_MISO) and PB15 (SPI2_MOSI)
  - Ethernet: Pin 1 (TX+) and Pin 3 (RX+), Pin 2 (TX-) and Pin 6 (RX-).
              Prepare an Ethernet cable accordingly or use an 
              "Ethernet Loopback Plug".

For driver testing with Server, please ensure that the connections required by 
related Server are made:
  - SPI: 
    - SPI2_MISO = PB14
    - SPI2_MOSI = PB15
    - SPI2_SCLK = PB10
    - SPI2_SS   = PI0
  - USART: 
    - USART1_TX = PB6
    - USART1_RX = PB7

If testing with a dedicated Server is used it is suggested to only enable 
respective peripheral testing (SPI or USART at a time).

Note: For usage with Server please connect GND between test board and Server 
      together.
