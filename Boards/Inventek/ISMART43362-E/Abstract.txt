CMSIS-Driver Validation Example Project for NXP LPCXpresso55S69 board with 
Inventek ISMART43362-E WiFi shield using ISM43362-M3G-L44-E es-WiFi module.

Features:
This uVision project can be used to test the CMSIS-Drivers for the LPC55S69 
against the driver specification. Configure the tests as follows:

  - Main function cmsis_dv() can be found in DV_Framework.c, where test cases
    are executed
  - Test configuration options can be set with the Configuration Wizard in
    DV_Config.h:
    - Test result output format (plain text/XML)
    - Buffer sizes and patterns
    - Driver numbers
    - Specific peripheral parameters
    - Enable/disable test cases
  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The following targets are available:

  - Create Report:
    Results and statistics are printed to the file TestReport\TestReport.xml
    through the ITM output (to examine the results, open the XML document with
    the browser of your choice).
 
  - Debug:
    Results and statistics are printed to the Debug (printf) Viewer window
    through the ITM output.

Debugger : ULINKplus

Packs (fixed) :
 - ARM::CMSIS                   v5.6.0
 - ARM::CMSIS-Driver            v2.5.0
 - ARM::CMSIS-Driver_Validation v1.4.0
 - Keil::ARM_Compiler           v1.6.2
 - NXP::LPC55S69_DFP            v12.0.0

IMORTANT NOTE:
  - Configure parameters in DV_Config.h under WiFi - Configuration to suit
    your testing environment
  - To run the tests the WiFi shield has to be reset by SW2 push-button and 
    in 5 seconds after that the debug session has to be started
    (the WiFi shield needs to be reset for initial cursor fetch and because 
     it cannot be reset by software it needs to be reset manually)
  - Module retarget_user.c is used to allow user retarget to work together 
    with Debug Console output. fsl_debug_console.c module is compiled with 
    "__MCUXPRESSO" define which is used to prevent Debug Console to override 
    putc and getc functions
