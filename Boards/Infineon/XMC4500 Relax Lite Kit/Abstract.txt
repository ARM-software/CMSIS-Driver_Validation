CMSIS-Driver Validation Example Project for Infineon 'XMC4500' microcontroller
using Infineon 'XMC4500 Relax Kit' Evaluation Board.

Features:
This uVision project can be used to test the CMSIS-Drivers for the XMC4500
against the driver specification. Configure the tests as follows:

  - Main function cmsis_dv() can be found in DV_Framework.c, where test cases
    are executed
  - Test configuration options can be set with the Configuration Wizard in
    DV_Config.h:
    - Test result output format (plain text/XML)
    - Buffer sizes and patterns
    - Driver numbers
    - Specific peripheral parameters
    - Enable/disable test cases
  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The following targets are available:

  - Create Report:
    Results and statistics are printed to the file TestReport\TestReport.xml
    through the ITM output (to examine the results, open the XML document with
    the browser of your choice).
 
  - Debug:
    Results and statistics are printed to the Debug (printf) Viewer window
    through the ITM output. Results are also available in the test_report
    buffer structure (always accessible in the watch window).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For driver loopback testing, please ensure that the following hardware
connections are made:

  - UART2: P0.4 (UART_RX)  and P0.5 (UART_TX)  (Header X2)
  - SPI0:  P5.0 (SPI_MOSI) and P5.1 (SPI_MISO) (Header X2)
  - Ethernet: Pin 1 (TX+) and Pin 3 (RX+), Pin 2 (TX-) and Pin 6 (RX-). Prepare
    an Ethernet cable accordingly or use an "Ethernet Loopback Plug".
